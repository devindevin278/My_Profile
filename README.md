# Devin's Profile

üñäÔ∏è Description üñäÔ∏è

This is a website that allows me to showcase my personal as well as professional brand. I include my proficiencies such as skills, tools and foreign languages. Besides, you can also find my educational background, projects I have accomplished, and more about me.

In the process of making this website, I implement tools like laravel and bootstrap to make it more efficient and effective in building an interactive and responsive profile website. Besides, I also use the AOS library to make my website more appealing by showing some of its eye-catching animation.

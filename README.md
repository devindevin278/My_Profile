# Devin's Profile

## Descriptin 🖊️

This is a website that allows me to showcase my personal as well as professional brand. I include my proficiencies such as skills, tools and foreign languages. Besides, you can also find my educational background, projects I have accomplished, and more about me.

In the process of making this website, I implement tools like **laravel** and **bootstrap** to make it more efficient and effective in building an interactive and responsive profile website. The bootstrap I use was installed using **NPM**, a tool in Node.js. In addition to that, I also use the **AOS** library to make my website more appealing by showing some of its eye-catching animation.
